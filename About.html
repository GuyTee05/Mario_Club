        <h2>About Mario</h2>
        <p> Created by video game designer Shigeru Miyamoto, Mario is an Italian plumber who resides in the Mushroom Kingdom with his younger twin brother, Luigi.Their adventures generally involve rescuing Princess Peach from the villain Bowser while using power-ups that give them different abilities.</p>
    
        <p> Mario first appeared as the player character of the 1981 platformer game Donkey Kong. Originally Miyamoto wanted to use Popeye as the protagonist, but was unable to acquire the licensing rights, leading him to create Mario.[24] Many elements of Mario's design were due to the graphical limitations of arcade hardware, such as a large nose, a mustache to excentuate his nose, and overalls to make his arms more identifiable.[25] Originally called "Mr. Video" and "Jumpman", he was renamed Mario after Nintendo of America's landlord, Mario Segale. Following his appearance in Donkey Kong, he would make cameo appearances in other video games before making his appearance in Super Mario Bros. (1985), a Nintendo Entertainment System game that started the Super Mario series. Charles Martinet voiced Mario from 1991 to 2023, before being succeeded by Kevin Afghani.</p>
